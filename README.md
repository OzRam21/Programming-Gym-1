# Programming-Gym-1
This is collection of short python scripts authored as a means for practicing the language and re-learning the it from the ground up. The No Starch Press book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart, was used as the guide for this self study series.

## Introduction
Body builders and athletes are seen as human marvels for demonstrating feats of strength and agility, or building highly defined muscle mass. However, they only get there through consistent practice, time in the gym, and pushing limits over time. Not every practice session or attempt at reaching new capabilities will be successful. There will be mistakes, close calls, and bad forms used. However, the important thing is to start somewhere, set goals, make mistakes, learn from them, and fix bad habits. 

My goal is to gain mastery over the python language, be able to author high impact scripts for automating networking tasks, and create well-written efficient applications. Currently, I can author short programs in python but I have to constantly reference documentation and books while doing so. Additionally, I need to practice more on OOP, using API's, creating GUIs, and interfacing safely with Operating Systems. While this repo will not touch on all those topics or them at all, it is meant as way to show a starting point, the consistency of practicing, and the growth over time. 

In summary, just as someone may dream of being a body builder, I dream of being in DevSecOps, a professional python developer, or a network automation expert. I know the only way to get there is through hard work, keeping track of progress, and documenting all my efforts. The programs written in this repo will be standalone and have no relation to one another, unless specifically labeled so. They may not be pretty, efficient, or have good programming style. That is ok because this is practice and will improve over time. To the newbie python programmer or person contemplating whether to start, I hope you are inspired to start and keep going. To the potential employer or collaborator, I hope you see the passion I have for learning, my consistency, and the growth I am capable of.

## Scope

This particular "Programming Gym" will only use one book as the learning material and guide for progressing. This may change later on and information will be updated accordingly. The book referenced is "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart, which is published by No Starch Press. 

In order to respect the copyright of the book and prevent copyright infringement, none of the demonstration python programs illustrated in the chapters or closely similar programs will be posted. These programs are available on the No Starch Press website. Towards the end of each chapter in this book, there are "Practice Projects" that list tasks for the reader to complete through their own original code, to solidify the learning material. These are only original programs will be available in this repo.    

## Technologies

* Python 3.9

## Launch 

1. Execute the file(s) from the cmd/terminal. 

## Status 

Project is done within the context of the original scope.

Programm details such as purpose, dependencies, and need packages are listed in the program comments.
